Instead, it was very juicy and rich, was a soft little bun that left no question that the real star was the double patty itself.

For drinks, we both started with the watermelon margarita on special and then had different drinks from their well put together cocktail menu.

The interior design is very cozy and cute. They have an outside patio with cute greenery and lights so we sat outside since it was a nice cool day. We ordered some cocktails, I got the Devereux Spritz and my partner got the Dr Feelgood. My drink was lighter with orange and prosecco which I crave for. The Dr Feelgood had a good chili kick with ginger so it was quite nice. For appetizer, we ordered the devils eggs and Mac and Cheese. The devils egg had crabs and okra so it was quite delicious and different from the traditional devil eggs I had. The mac and cheese had pesto and some nice breadcrumbs on top so it was very creamy and flavourful. Our main entree is the fried chicken with mash potatoes and collard greens. The fried chicken was super tender and juicy! The outer layer was just right and not over breadcrumbs. They had this delicious blueberry hot honey where you drizzle a bit on the food and it gives a nice tingy flavor. I really enjoyed all the food! Lastly, we got their main dessert brownies with ice cream. They recommended we drizzle some blueberry hot honey on top as well and it tasted delicious! Highly recommended to check it out. **If you decide to sit outdoor, make sure to spray some bug repellents or wear long sleeves and pants to cover yourself. Got quite a few mosquitoes bites but with the cute ambiance outdoor it was worth it. They offered us bug repellents and etc.**The service was excellent.

The Khao Sol house specialty curry was incredibly complex, the curry with some nice heat at the end, the noodles terrific and the succulent chicken literally falling off the drumstick--could have eaten it all day, and hated that we had agreed to share.That wasn't even my highlight, though--the steamed fish prepared and served in a coconut shell (Hor Mok Talay) was so inventive and flavorful, literally stuffed with seafood.

In the back, however, industrial fans take away from the vibe, but in the summer, it's an okay trade off.No alcohol menu; BYOB.The Moo yang hor khao neual (pork tenderloin roll) is a great appetizer to share; two rolls of meat, chopped to bite size. spicy, sweet, sour is all in there. If the 'spicy' is a scare, you can enjoy it without; the spicy is brought out in the chili dipping sauce. The Duck Breast curry: this is a great opportunity to try jackfruit- this is likely the best way to taste it if you've never had jackfruit before and you know it's a commitment if you had to buy the whole fruit. The duck breast is tender, and goes well with the jasmine rice. It comes with peppers, green beans, small tomatoes, tangerines, eggplant and kale. Perhaps the Tangerines could be supremed to let out more of the sweetness? This is an uncommon but interesting flavor combo to try.The dessert of the day: Taro, coconut, warm sweet milk.

By the way, last night was their 2nd night so it was a bit chaotic. It was pouring out, but people kept coming in to check out this new Thai restaurant in the neighborhood. Because I was by myself so I didn't have to wait long and was seated in a big table (Huge shoutout to my waiter! This guy deserves it) I told him he could move other customers to that big table and I could wait, but he said that he would rather get me seated right away. THANK YOU! He was also super polite & nice. I was hungry so I tried to order way too much for one person and he recommended me something in a smaller portion that was best for one person. I ended up ordering Iced Thai Coffee. I honestly wish that they would have had more options with milk. I didn't really want half & half with my coffee, but again it was their only 2nd night! So I suggested them this as well. Then I ordered Tom Yum Soup (Shrimp) for $6 which was perfect for me! I also ordered some white rice and Pork Tenderloin Roll (Moo Yang Hor Khao Neaw) -- basically Grilled Pork Tenderloin stuffed with sticky rice. I have to say that I liked the combination. Although a few pieces were kinda hard to chew, but I still liked the flavor of it. Tom Yum was definitely amazing. My bill came out about $30 with tips so yeah, it was pretty pricey, but I have gone to a bunch of Thai restaurants and this one is definitely one of the great ones.

The sweet potato fries and mac&cheese were good... & the sprouts french fries were MEGA salty- it took away from the flavor, the french fries tasted like the were microwaved and on top of that were cold & the most unfortunate let down... the chicken: subpar to say the least.

I love fried chicken, I love spicy food, so good spicy fried chicken is well worth the trip.They don\\'t accept reservations, and they have a white board in front of the entrance where you write your name on. There were about 5-6 names in front of ours, but we only waited 20-30 minutes, which wasn\\'t that bad considering it wasn\\'t winter. Oh yea - there\\'s no room to wait inside. We were seated at the bar, since there are probably 6-7 tables max in the entire place.We ordered the BBQ Shrimp and Fried Grits which was really delicious and it was a perfect portion for two to share. Then we both got the \\'Extra Hot\\' fried chicken. I had it with Sweet potato fries. The fried chicken was so juicy, the skin was crispy and spicy and there was a good amount of heat on the meat as well. Their \"hot sauce\" that they have on the table wasn\\'t very spicy though, but it added a nice flavor to the meat. The sweet potato fries were stellar as well! So I had a very enjoyable experience the first time.However, the second time was a big disappointment. Long story short, the menu changed and prices went up and food quality went down. We ordered the Fried Green Tomatoes - these were great, and Mac and Cheese - mediocre for apps. Based on the great experience the first time, we got the Extra Hot Fried Chicken again, but it was NOT SPICY!! I was so disappointed, and the \\'hot sauce\\' tasted different and so I didn\\'t even bother to use it. The service was completely awful and we waited forever to get our orders placed, to get a box for the leftover food and also to receive our checks.I really hope that the quality goes back to how it was before.'),\n",

There was a half hour wait, we added our names to a white board at the front (which is such a cool idea) and waited outside as the front area and restaurant itself is very small and cramped. We were seated by the window in the front which was very lovely. We started with the fried green tomatoes and loaded baked grits as I had never had grits before (and I lived in the south for four years!!!) the fried green tomatoes came with this (I think aioli) sauce on it and it was SO GOOD. I would come back just to order five of these all for myself. The grits were incredible as well. So glad this was my first time trying them, what a treat! I was in the mood for eggs so I ordered scrambled eggs (big mistake!!!!) they were okay but nothing spectacular, kind of dry. My boyfriend got the chicken sandwich and I wish I had too, it was so delicious. I was immediately jealous after he let me try a bite. The coffee was actually really good too. Only reason I'm giving it 4/5 is because our waitress was so slow. She also forgot to bring my coffee for about fifteen minutes and repeatedly took forever to bring things we asked for, we noticed it was the same for the table next to us too. It's not a super crowded place because the restaurant is so small, so it's not like she had a million tables to tend to at once.

But somewhat painful. I will say it looks like they're inconsistent with how much spice goes on the chicken -- the girls at the table next to us also ordered the hot chicken, but ours definitely had a lot more spice mix on it. \\xa0The pickles were crisp and delicious, and cut through some of the spiciness.

He offered us unthinkable flexibility -- from the number of people we wanted (we were so unsure of how many would rally after the wedding and he was comfortable with that) to the food we wanted (they'd make anything from their menu or if we wanted to come up with something else they'd make that, or if we wanted to bring in pizza he was ok with that too!)

Both means were individually delicious, there was zero food envy at the table and the sorrels we bought were great additions.Personally, the jerk bowl doesn't need anything... it was great by itself.

Indeed it was, I'll never try that again since there was star anise involved and it was bitter, neither of which I like. The sorrel here is different from what I've had in other places as it was almost syrupy sweet and strongly flavored, it's not something I'd order again. They do make and bottle their own hot sauce, which I was told wasn't spicy but flavorful. I dipped just the end of the tine of my fork to taste, and I immediately had to drink my water. Not spicy?! To each their own!I chose the salmon ($16) with brown rice and chickpeas served with coconut ginger sauce. The salmon is a little more than one inch strip that was just a touch overcooked and slightly sweet. The coconut ginger sauce was tasty and done well, but I feel that they could have been more generous with it. Curry chickpeas were lightly flavored in a good way. I feel that the price point is wrong with the amount of food or vice versa, that is given for this neighborhood. So, unless you have money to burn or you're really hankering for some coconut ginger sauce, I can't really recommend this place for the financially (and hungry) conscious.Tl;dr: Overpriced for the amount of food they giveSmall amount of salmon fillet givenNot enough tasty coconut ginger sauceCurry chickpeas lightly flavored, in a good way\"),\n",

I usually get the Pablo crusted salmon, with white rice, red beans and sautéed kale covered in their red spicy sauce. I love when food is served pipping hot and their food is always served hot.

The decor was fresh and clean, but I was seated next to a wall barrier with plants that was a bit in my head space, literally. The bathroom was clean and spacious, and probably pleasant if they weren't burning incense in there. They give you complimentary chips that has a bit of a spicy topping to it that is cut on the thicker side and crispy. Brussel sprouts were pretty good but I feel like it was drowned too much in the sauce as some was crispy in the beginning but became mushy towards the end. The pork loin was bordering on the spicy side due to whatever rub they were using, but I did enjoy it since it wasn't dry though, the crispy fries that came with it, could've used more salt. Oddly, when asked for BBQ sauce, they didn't have any... but they serve bbq items... hmm. My food partner and I, both ordered the smoke ramen. I'm disappointed even though I had low expectations. The smokiness was there but, there was no depth in flavor for the broth, which wasn't much as well. You only get that umami flavor when the broth has been simmered for hours with certain ingredients. My food partner thought their broth was really good (because they added spicy garlic paste to it) until they had some spoonfuls of mine which didn't have add ons and was disappointed for me. The noodles were fine, the smoked pork loin was on the leaner side which was great, but didn't fall apart like other ramen places I've been to. My test is usually to try the classic ramen at every place I go to so there's a baseline but I jumped the gun on this one. The servers were quite nice so maybe I'll come back one day and the review will be different. Until then, I can't in good faith, recommend coming to this place for their smoked ramen.

Before coming here, I had seen this restaurant on television a few days prior on one of the food networks and mentioned how I would like to go here and so to me surprise, ended up here. Now I would advise before going here to make reservations because even on a Tuesday night, this place gets crowded to where a line is waiting outside of the establishment. Due to not having a reservation, we had to actually wait until they gave us the option to eat outside where a few tables were available. One of the things that surprised us was how attentive our waiter was towards his customers, he really showed interest. Enough of that, you want to know what we had and here it is. We ordered the Connecticut which is a Buttered Lobster Roll which comes with a few different side options such as fries in which I chose, a Baked Potato, Spinach and others. The Lobster Roll was pretty good but it comes only buttered and not with the Mayonnaise and celery and other goods that you are used to seeing on Lobster rolls. We also had the Crab Dip in which we saw on the show was well liked and highly suggested but unfortunately when we had it, it was first too salty to the point where we had to have our waiter take it back and when the new one came around, it lacked Salt and a bit of flavor and the chips it came with was wrong for it due to it being too burnt and with Old Bay Seasoning. Oh well, I guess you win some and you lose some. We had these fried Oysters with Spinach on top which was an interesting mix together which was only OKAY, not the best and probably due to the Spinach being too strong. The Star of the night and the last dish that we had was the 1.5 Pound lobster which was Huge for a 1.5 pounder and even could have passed for a 2 pounder. This Lobster was cooked perfectly and tasted great and BEST OF ALL WAS FRESH! A lot of the times when you go to Seafood Restaurants, the Seafood doesn't always taste as fresh as it should but here, that wasn't a problem. The lobster came with potatoes, and sausage in which we had the option in adding. The Sausage in which they used was good too. As for the price, this place isn't cheap so if you are looking for a cheapy but goodie, this isn't it! These items plus 4 glasses of wine ran us to about 150.

She saved herself when she came right after taking THEIR order and apologizing saying she\\'s going to take our order now and that she knows we were there before them. Now, I don\\'t know if she still put their order first before ours because their side came out first but that may be because we had ordered one BLT Lobster Roll, one side order of fried pickles(super salty and sour), and two of the Maine lobster dinners which are $25 all day on Wednesdays including $1 oysters and $5 drafts during Happy Hour from Tuesdays to Fridays from 3-6pm at the bar but they were decent enough to mention that it\\'s for the bar. We also ordered an extra side order of sweet potato fries to go after trying the delicious, hot fries that came with my BLT Lobster Roll. In addition to that, we ordered half dozen of the raw oyster HH special and then ordered another set again since they were so fresh and clean. By the end of the lunch, we left very satisfied and no hard feelings towards the waitress. Pros. Delicious sweet potato fries.

A block and a half away from the Wilson stop, this neighborhood is a combination of the gentrification of Bushwick and the residential area that was here before gentrification.Father Knows Best is a great spot to do work, without the commitment of being a coffee shop. So, in the afternoon one can have a beer while she works, as opposed to cold brew coffee. They do have that here. Food proportions are reasonable, but not especially big or generous. Coffee is competitive, but prices for beer and liquor are just about the same as the best places in Bushwick, such as the Johnson's off of the Jefferson stop. I would say it's more of a work spot than a hook up or party spot, but they do get lively on weekends like most of the bars in Bushwick. They have a rotating list of events on their weekly calendar, including sometimes karaoke, trivia, and many others. This bar is excellent for having a conversation, and they have a great backyard deck. The deck is great for smoking, too, and while I don't personally smoke I can see that people can use that.Bartenders are intelligent, capable, and hardworking. The bartenders here deserve 5 stars, too. \\xa0For things to fix, I wish they had Lion's Head beer, which is dirt cheap and they can sell for dirt cheap, like $2 a beer. I also wish they had stage shows like theater or stand-up comedy. I don't necessarily want any open-mics, because I realize those can be obnoxious.

It was pretty loaded which was nice but I also began feeling sick of it after some bites. If you're not the biggest fan of nachos, or if you're ehhhh about nachos in general, this dish might be better shared with someone else. Don't get me wrong, it is still delicious! It might just feel like too many flavors happening per bite which was slightly overwhelming for me!Coffee wise, I got an iced latte. I was a little disappointed that they didn't have any flavor syrups for their coffee. If you're a huge flavored coffee fan like I am, you WILL have to opt for simple syrup in your coffee here. Besides that, the espresso was still strong and smooth. No burnt espresso taste at all. Service was also awesome.

Sucks, as I was having brunch with a vegetarian and someone with multiple food allergies. They did have a few vegetarian options, but we wouldn't be able to customize items without meat, so choices were very limited. (tragic.) My friend with allergies originally wanted to order an item, asking it be made without avocados- but they couldn't do that for him so he ordered the biscuits. My boyfriend (vegetarian) ordered a breakfast burrito, they offered the chorizo add for meat eaters. I ordered the mushroom hash and added two poached eggs. For being pre-made or whatever the case, the food took a bit of time to come out. The server accidentally brought my boyfriend the burrito with chorizo, which he wouldn't have realized it had meat had I not tasted it first.

There were 2 waiters servicing the whole floor and they were spread very thin. We kept asking for water refills, no-one checked in on us during our meal, and when we needed the check we had to go up to their desk to request it because we couldn't get their attention multiple times.\"),\n",

We had 6:30pm reservations but got there a little earlier and we were seated at our table, which was really a 2 counter top table facing the cooks. The restaurant itself is small and since I was a party of 2, I didn't think they would give us any of the 4 top tables anyways. Our server was really friendly and went over the food and drink menu. The drinks were very good. I recommend the revenge of the line if you like drinks with a little kick and spice to it. Super good. My brother had the bruce banner and it was also really good. For dinner I had the beef short rib ($23) which came with some potatoes and spinach. The beef short rib was very tender. It went very well with the potatoes and greens. The presentation was beautiful and for the price, much cheaper than all the places we tried in the city. My brother got the special which was a type of fish (trout?). It was a whole fish and he enjoyed it as well. For dessert we had the berry crumble w/ sea salt ice cream ($8) this was soooo good and half the price of a much worse dessert in the city we paid for at a fancier place. Warm gooey berry pie and cold sea salt ice cream....delicious!Overall, this restaurant was amazing. From the service, to the décor, to the drinks and food. I know it recently opened, so I hope it stays around for a long time. Also, the restaurant is literally down the street from the L line which can take you to NYC 14th St union square station easily.

We left NOTHING on our plates at the end of our meal. Every morsel was happily devoured.The crawfish etoufee was a standout and our favorite dish of the evening. It is so flavorful and filling.. definitely a must if you come here.The BBQ shrimp is drenched in an amazing Worcestershire sauce that you can dip your shrimp and some bread into. We both loved this sauce. Note: the shrimp is served with its head and shell on, so it will require some work... but it will be worth it.Lastly, the red beans and rice was really delicious and the meat was tender and smoky. There aren't any desserts on the menu, but at the end of the meal we were given complimentary shots of this mousse made with Cafe du Monde coffee. It was a very nice gesture and a great way to end an awesome meal. We were also able to meet the owner, John, and we talked with him about his Louisiana roots. He was very friendly and nice and we will definitely come back to continue supporting his business.In sum, this restaurant is definitely a must-try for those of you who love Cajun food and are pining for some in Brooklyn.

So people sometimes ask me where to go for Cajun in NY and I haven\\'t had many places to steer them. This is the place. The space is tiny, I\\'m already afraid of what happens when the rest of the city catches on to their greatness and wait times become agonizingly long. But for now, four 2 tops and a handful of seats at the bar offer an intimate atmosphere.

Crystal\\'s on the table, Abita Purple Haze - this is happiness. They offer $1 happy hour oysters, and these were the best $1 oysters I\\'ve ever had. East Coast, I forget the name now but I was thrilled.Me and my friend ordered all the big hits: gumbo, half and half fried oyster and fried shrimp po-boy, BBQ shrimp, and crawfish etouffee. I almost cried when I took my first bite of gumbo. I know, that sounds hyperbolic but this is just not something you can get easily, if at all, in NY. The roux is so dark, crab claws and shrimp poke out cheekily, the bright crunch of scallions, okra (not slimy), the perfectly cooked rice soaking up the complex flavors of it all. Ooompf. My friend said she had never eaten such soft fried shrimp as were on this po-boy. And I don\\'t think I\\'ve had a fresher, more flavorful fried oyster. Served on French bread and dressed with mayo, lettuce, tomato, and pickles, this is a no brainer. The BBQ shrimp are served head on, in Worcestershire & butter. The sauce was excellent, the shrimp were delicious, my only wish was the sauce penetrated into the shrimp a bit more, but still a strong choice. I don\\'t think you can order wrong here!That etoueffe though. Crawfish, bell peppers, onion, celery, shellfish gravy with rice. I\\'ve never attempted to make this like I have gumbo and jambalaya. To me, this dish is royalty. When it\\'s done right the world bows down to acknowledge it and this was perfect. Despite two of us ordering two apps and two entrees and oysters, every plate went back to the kitchen licked clean. I met the chef and owner afterwards, John, and hugged him and rambled on about how much my friend and I enjoyed his food and loved his city. He pretended like my intensity was totally normal and for that I\\'m very grateful! Also want to give a shout out to Zack, our sweet and attentive waiter who makes going above and beyond look effortless! More good things: the pacing of the food is on point. You\\'re never rushed, despite the small space, this is food meant to be savored and it\\'s presented in a way that lets you.

Maybe if they mixed it a little better it would've had a better taste on the palate.I must say the fried oysters were really good; I think they had them as add ons on the menu for $1-2.Although the food was good, the experience was underwhelming.

We ordered the garlic butter sauce and it was just okay. Nothing to call home about. There was a DJ playing really good throwback R&B and Rap.

(I've come on a random Wednesday night and a random Thursday night when the craving struck and it was full but not overly so) Tonight I wandered in with two of my favorite eating buddies L.C. and D.G.. We each ordered a boil (1 lb snow crab with sausage and potatoes, mild. Two orderes of 1 lb shrimp+1 lb snow crab, medium). As L.C. and D.G. are good eaters, we took advantage of the 1 dollar wing and 1 dollar oyster happy hour deal by ordering 10 wings and 3 oysters. Combined with a few pouches of drinks, we were pretty much set for a good night. The wings, very much like their Chinatown location, were crispy, fresh, and delicious. The boils were everything I expected, saucy, delicious mildly spiced (as I preferred), with red potatoes and sausage cut on bias for optimal sauce coverage. So where did my oysters come in? They came with the option of raw vs grilled and I chose raw. However, they came out just after my boil. And by just after my boil, I mean literally that we got our boils and then a plate of my oysters was delivered to the table. At this point the wings had come and went. They were blue point oysters, decently fresh, and at a dollar an oyster, a great value. All in all the food was good though I would have wanted my oysters to come out with the other appetizers. So why three stars? In the end, I did have to remind the server that I had ordered raw oysters and wasnt really given an explanation as to why it took almost 40 minutes for three oysters to get to the table. Additionally, our server was very nice but her co-worker was very rude when she came to collect our check. I guess if I were to separate, the food was four stars while the service was closer to a two. Maybe it was an unexpected Sunday night rush? Who knows.\"),\n",

The Bartender gave us something entirely different but we assume it was because she couldn\\'t hear us clearly over the music. Who knows. Regardless, my boyfriend and I left the place yelling that we found our new spot! For days we were tryna come up with excuses to come back ASAP.Fast forward abt 1 month: We went back at the end of August excited to order the shrimp & grits again and try the Endless Mimosas. Everything was terrible. The Mimosas left an aftertaste and might as well have been virgin Mimosas. The real disappointment was that they seemed to have changed up the shrimp & grits recipe or they got a new cook, who knows, but they were both NASTY. They changed up the shrimp sauce so it was milky and thick. All of our shrimp was over cooked. The grits were chalky and pasty. Hellll noooo.The waitress came over started cleaning off our table and grabbed our plates without asking if we were finished or saying anything--my boyfriend was still eating. There was clearly still food in both of his bowls, but she just grabbed them away. He tried to tell her he wasn\\'t finished but the music was so loud that he literally had to scream it her even though she was standing right next to him. She apologized.Now on to paying for our bill... Meanwhile the waitress really tried to overcharge us by saying \"didn\\'t y\\'all order a Riesling too?\" After that entire 20 minute meal we both looked at her like \"Really bih? You gotta be kidding yourself.\" Yeah right, not after that nasty mimosa. They misleadingly say that they do a mandatory 20% gratuity for groups. But the truth is they do it no matter if it\\'s 1 person or 2 person. We understand why now. The place is so relaxed to a fault when it comes to cleanliness and service. The hostess we had in August was leaning her elbows and arms on the tables while she was helping people. \\xa0Both times we went on a Sunday.

I ordered the Sweet Stuffed Plantain and fish tacos. Don't judge me I was hungry from walking about 15 minutes to this place. Side bar if you take the 2 or 3 train do yourself the favor and take the B44 down and walk over to the bar. I psyched myself into thinking the President St. stop was only about 5minutes away.

I haven't gone but will try to get my butt over here. Decent drinks on a budget. Yeah that's for me. I will les likely come here if it's outside of Happy Hour and not going there to dance.

Couple minutes later waitress #1 bought out 2 shrimp dishes which never made sense to me because I didn\\'t order one because I\\'m allergic (and I definitely told her this) but she politely apologized and took it back. Five minutes after that my Tan Tan ramen finally arrived and I started eating. Two bites in I felt my throat, tongue, and mouth starting to itch and also my lips starting to swell. Alarmed, I called waitress #2 over and asked her if there was any sesame product in my dish and she confirmed that it was in fact made with sesame paste. I told her that waitress #1 insisted that there was none. Waitress #1 came over and apologized which was cool I guess but my thing is that I have an actual allergy.

Prices are a BIT steep but oh boy is it worth it. I highly recommend the shrimp & grits. The grits were fluffy and flavorful and the shrimp blackened to perfection. But the sauce was amazing. Have this dish! We also had a great jambalaya. The crawfish bisque was also a must-have. Everything tastes like authentic cajun food fresh from NOLA.The staff was also totally charming.

It was my first time having foie gras, and it was really deep and because more delicious with every bite and paired so well with the apricots! We also had the cheese souffle appetizer, (Please get it!!) which came with gorgonzola ice-cream. You eat this by making a hole in the souffle, and eating it with the ice-cream, creating a heavenly mix of sweet and salty. For our entrees, we had the bouillabaisse and duck. The duck didn't blow me away, but was still good and rich. The bouillabaisse was amazing, especially the soup paired with the bread and dip it comes with. For dessert, we had some sorbets, which they make in house! I loved the atmosphere and the service as well. We sat outside in the back, which was like a garden. Our waitress was so kind and patient in explaining everything on the menu and how to best enjoy the meal!

Boy were we impressed.The Date Night special is a prix fixe mystery menu served every Tuesday. For $100/2 people (so $50/pp), you get, as the website says, \"3 courses along with a bottle of red, white or rose.\" For a French restaurant of this caliber, this screams deal of the century.Your chosen bottle of wine arrives first of course. We chose the red wine as recommended by our waiter. It was a solid French red from the Languedoc region. It wasn\\'t the fanciest wine ever but it was buttery smooth, which is how I prefer my reds. After that, you don\\'t get 3 courses, but 4! Soup of the day or salad, an appetizer (2 choices), a main (2 choices), and a dessert (1 choice, though each person receives their own). Tea and coffee after dinner are INCLUDED in the prix fixe! That alone is $5-6 in most restaurants.We both got the soup to start, a delicious, complex, and slightly spicy turnip soup. I didn\\'t think I would like it but it turned out to be very appetizing. We then received our apps: mackerel for me, souffle au fromage for my girlfriend. Both fantastic and they complemented each other very well since the souffle was so rich and the mackerel was so light. It was clear the menu was designed with sharing in mind. Then our mains: dorade and hen. Once again, the two dishes were beautifully executed, delicious, and complementary. The hen was a substitute dish pulled from the a la carte menu as my girlfriend doesn\\'t eat pork and the other main on the prix fixe was braised pork. Dessert was a green apple tart set in a solid chocolate \"cup.\" Super delicate, light, and tasty. After dessert my girlfriend ordered a latte and I ordered a cappuccino, both of which were great.Only a couple dishes on the prix fixe were lifted from the a la carte menu, the rest, including the mains (the dorade and braised pork), were unique creations for the night. Awesome!They do offer the a la carte menu if for whatever reason you don\\'t want the Date Night prix fixe, and I was impressed by what was available. Whole, pan seared foie gras is so hard to come by these days with everyone mashing it into a cold pate (WHY???) and that odd legislation calling for its ban. The wine menu is also very extensive and surprisingly reasonable! Flipping through it I saw good French bottles in the low $20s... unheard of at these high tier French restaurants!The ambiance was very cute with candlelight, silver utensils, and banquettes. We were seated side-by-side at one of those banquettes, which I love. One wall is covered in a chalkboard list of all the farms that they gather their ingredients from. Great to be supporting all those farms!All in all, a wonderful meal. The Date Night special is incredibly good value and I would happily return with my girlfriend just for that mystery menu... or the foie gras. The chef is clearly gifted and is offering very, very reasonable prices for top notch, traditional French food. We will be back!'),\n",

I ordered the burger medium expecting it to be just as amazing as I remembered it and it came back fully cooked -- no pink. The bottom bun was still cold. The mushrooms were wet and cold. And the top bun was burned and dry as if someone tried to toast or reheat an old piece of bread they had in the freezer. The beef itself was flavorless. I explained my concerns to the wait staff and he kindly returned it and had it remade. The new burger I got was basically the same-- dry bun, the kind that breaks in half when you try to take a bite, wet cold mushroom atop a flavorless beef patty that was still medium well. At this point I let my partner eat it (he'd eat anything haha), and I ate about 2 servings of fries.

The deviled eggs were fantastic. Flavorful and perfect texture. Them fries though! There was delicately shredded Parmesan piled on top and it was accompanied by 2 dips that seemed house made, some type of aioli and a ketchup. I finished every bite. And still ended up blacking out later that night but that's not the point. I would definitely come back here with a friend, date, even someone visiting. Great vibe, food, and drinks. Reasonably priced and happy hour til 8!\"),\n",

It was a very soft burger overall, the meat/patty/onions/sauces were all soft and basically melted into each other--there was no crunch. However, crunch did come from the very skinny fries. The pretzel bun, the sauce, the meat, the cheese, and the onions are all individually delicious, so coming together it crafted the best burger!!! I tried to savor it for as long as possible, which was very difficult. I just wish that there was a crunch component built into the burger. It is a very messy burger, but it's all a part of the eating experience. I wish the fries were a bit more potato-ier as it was mostly just fried crunch outsides.

The fries that come with the burger had a nice light crisp to them, and were the perfect serving size to share. On that note, even though I would have loved to have an entire burger to myself, I think the pizza is great enough that sharing the burger and a pizza (or multiples depending on group size) is certainly the move.

Both dishes were nicely spicy, just the way we like it! The flavors were very good and the prices were reasonable. This is a great casual restaurant, perfect for an easy lunch or dinner. The noodles in the Drunken Noodles were a tad overcooked and fell apart a bit, but the flavor was terrific, so I ended up not minding the noodles pieces. The dish would be absolutely perfect if they cooked the noodle less. The Thai iced tea was amazing and one of the best that I've ever had. Considering how busy they were on their opening weekend, I think Amy is a huge hit and will only grow in popularity. I hope she stays.\"),\n",

In fact, if they were open past midnight I think they'd be in trouble, but handsomely profitable because it would be so packed on weekends after late night fun. Or, maybe us local taco lovers would be the ones in trouble. Please, I'd put my kitchen on 'time-out' and come here ALL the time without even thinking!I ordered takeout from here a couple years ago and the only reason why I forgot to return again is because it cost $55 for my friend and I to attempt to get full off one meal here from takeout, not even dining in with tip.

I personally feel the (taco) portions are small but it won't stop me from coming back after this second go 'round. The taco but was only one layer of soft shell tortilla that actually stayed put till the last bite. I will tell you, this is not your usual 'struggle' taco. On one end I was thinking the taco was so small and I finished it so fast that maybe it didn't have time to fall apart, but after complete evaluation, this taco is solid and champion status, if you ask me. There was NOT a ridiculous amount of greasy steak juice and there was no soggy tortilla letting the steak escape anywhere except to my tastebuds. I have a sister who used to cry when her tacos fell apart and I know if I brought her here, she wouldn't have any complaints! The flavor, oh boy, was memorable and I love that the taco already comes with a sliver of avocado! They know what they're doing in that kitchen. The service was great too. The lady at the register saw me struggling on what to order as I looked thru the giant menu on the wall and asked me if I needed help while offering me my very own paper menu. I thought that was pretty nice. Most places you walk in and you can't get a hello unless you're the first to open your mouth and all they wanna do is collect your cash and get to the next customer.

The menu included a lot of Asian fusion dishes which all sounded delicious, as well as some dessert options. We started with an order of well seasoned Charred Broccoli ($8) and perfectly fried Herb French Fries ($5) that we dipped into Houssain ketchup and spicy mayo. Not long after, we were given our main courses: Fresh Handmade Wide Noodles w/ Shrimp and Lobster Essence ($21), Pang Fried Noodles with Braised Pork ($16), and Braised Beef Short Rib over rice ($19). The portions are quite substantial and we all ended up boxing leftovers. I personally ordered the handmade wide noodles which came with vegetables atop noodles and covered in a subtle shrimp/lobster sauce. The dish tasted similar to an Asian version of shrimp scampi, which turned out to be delicious and definitely better the day after. I tried a bit of Pang fried noodles, as well, from my friend and it was the right amount of crispy noodles to vegetable to meat ratio with all the flavor. However, I will say that particular dish can get a bit salty after a while. We unfortunately had no room for dessert.

My gripe with this place honestly isn't about the food. The food was usually great, and they were accommodating of a food allergy many times (though not always). As I've mentioned many times I have a mushroom allergy. Usually this isn't a big deal. Most places will just leave it out and typically Hunger Pang was willing to do this. Why wouldn't they? They'd charge the same and save a few cents on ingredients. Because we had gone many times, I feel obligated to give it 4 stars. However, here's my caveat. I'm not sure if it's the owner, but the main guy there just always seemed like a dark cloud over what should've been a fun and happy place. They were normally packed. But on more than one occasion I heard him treat customers badly, or staff. I happened to be one of those customers. Normally when mentioning my allergy it wasn't a big deal. I'd order the Pang fried noodles with the pork (highly recommend this), and mention no mushrooms, please. I don't encounter this attitude often, but some pretentious restaurants get offended by allergies and don't take them seriously. I watched him roll his eyes and ten or twenty minutes later out came my food with, you guessed it, mushrooms. I had to send it back after seeing it, but unfortunately had already eaten a small amount. My night was ruined because of this. And honestly, if not for the interactions I've had watching, or on the receiving end, of this guy's pretentious attitude I would give it a 5 stars. Maybe he's changed since then, or maybe he doesn't work there anymore. But it still is a great place to eat, so long as you don't care about this dark cloud that occasionally might swing by and mess up their normally cheerful atmosphere.

I\\'ve been here twice with friends and both times we had our minds completely blown by the amazing food as well as the quality of service (shout out to Jaday, the waitress, I\\'m sorry if I spelled your name wrong). Both times, she was super attentive but not in an overbearing way. \\xa0The first time, my friend and I ordered the pangry wings with king sauce (spicy), and the salt and pepper popcorn shrimp for appetizers, and downed a bottle each of the deliciously fruity Bluffer wine. For our main course, we ordered the general Guan\\'s roasted chicken, which came with a HUGE helping of fries, which we asked to be upgraded to \"truffle fries\" for a couple of extra dollars - well worth it! The chicken is sooo good! Juicy and tender throughout, with a crispy skin coated in a delicious glaze. We also ordered the pang fried noodles, which were my least favorite, not because they weren\\'t delicious, but because there were too many veggies for me to enjoy the glutinous noodles. We had the chocolate cake for dessert, which I need to know how they make because it is is soooooooo soft, and creamy, and delicious and just warms your soul. The next time we went, we brought another friend, and had the same appetizers, wine and General Guan\\'s roasted chicken (amazing again!). We decided to try the Jalapeño fried rice with shrimp, and the homemade wide egg noodles with braised short rib. Let me just say, the braised short rib melted in my mouth, the noodles were THICK and well coated in the sauce, and not too many veggies like the other noodles. The jalapeño fried rice is my new favorite! They were unlike any fried rice I\\'ve ever had - the flavors were excellent, with a hint of ginger, and topped with an over easy egg. We had the chocolate cake again. And had to order a second even though we were full. Its that good. The three of us left the place and in a state of euphoria. It is unbelievable that I only have one picture of the food - a photo of three spoons fighting over the last piece of cake. I\\'ll take better pics next time. Needless to say, we\\'ll be back! :)'),\n",

However, once I started eating, I didn\\'t feel like I was missing out one bit.Pork Chive & Cheddar Dumpling - my dining partner was absolutely enamored of this dish, and I had to give up more than my \"half\" of the cheddar crisp on the plate. This was a beautiful and fun dish, and we loved it, even if he wasn\\'t initially enthusiastic about ordering this.Spicy Tuna Avocado Bowl - we were a little too ambitious and ordered this as a starter, but the few bites we had we loved. \\xa0The tuna was fresh, and the greens, garlic crisps, and cherry tomatoes made for a lovely bit of freshness in between all the fat we were indulging in. This \\\\might be a great alternative to healthier eaters in your group.My lunch buddy had the Pork Belly Benedict, and while I found this to be a bit too rich for me, he absolutely loved this. \\xa0I had the P.L.A.T. - two generous slabs of pork belly, with lettuce, avocado (lots of avocado), tomato and aioli on a toasted bun, and I\\'d happily come back for this again and again. \\xa0To go along with this, a very generous side of crisp fries were provided to dip into spicy mayo and hoisin ketchup.Before we left (as if we weren\\'t going to come back anyway), Wally sold us on the chicken that I absolutely need to try next. Medwin Pang has an absolute little gem here, and I already have friends clamoring to try this spot too.'),\n",

There are banks within a block of this restaurant :).After getting Cash I came back to be immediately seated for a table for 2. This place is so cute and is very well priced. We were in the area for a concert at the Barclays center so this was an excellent find.First to note this place is very budget friendly, which was a huge plus. Banh mis from $7 and pho from $10. We thought everything looked so good we started ordering a bunch. We ordered the shrimp summer rolls and the shrimp chips and salsa to start. The summer rolls were nice and refreshing the peanut sauce was everything you look for in one. Packed with flavor and gives you a craving to keep wanting more!The shrimp chips and salsa really hit the spot. The flavor combination was divine and my friend and I both were just so happy we ordered it. It was also pretty cool to hear the noise the shrimp chips make as you put the salsa on it.All the food came out rapidly so before we were even done with the first few chips and our first summer roll my short rib pho came out. I HIGHLY recommend this Pho!! I am not normally the one to order. Eef pho as I limit how much red meat I will eat. This was amazing! The short rib meat was melt in your mouth and the broth was delicious! At only $12 it was a steal. I was so stuffed by the time we left.My friend ordered the viet banh mi tacos and seemed to really enjoy them.

Really nice choice. The Pho was average at best. Small bean sprouts dish for the size of the Pho. The chicken wasn't well seasoned and the broth was quite bland. The appetizers were good. I found the peanut sauce with the summer rolls to be flavorful. The spring rolls were tasty but nothing outstanding. The service was quick. Almost too quick to be honest. Our orders were taken nearly as soon as we sat down, dishes were removed as we finished our last bite, and the check was placed before we could ask. It almost seemed that the servers were more interested in getting us in and out as fast as possible than us enjoying the food.I felt the price was a little steep considering we were outside the city, the quality, and portion sizes.

We started with the Korean Chicken Nuggets. It wasn't enough flavor and the homemade sauce on the side which was supposed to be hot had a weird sweet taste to it. My girlfriend got the Sweet Chilli Bun and couldn't finish it due to it's lack of flavor. We tried one more thing which was the Korean Ramen. We got it spicy with chicken. To my surprise the chicken was just the nuggets we already had (wish we would have known that), the broth resembled chicken noodle soup and the noodles were extremely hard.

It's not particularly kid friendly but if your kids are pretty mature, well behaved and adventurous eaters, it's ok for them. Soju (Korean alcoholic rice drink) is tasty and similar to a not so strong Russian vodka but w/ rice instead of potatoes.Fried tofu & shiitake buns are my favorite. They switched out the artichoke bun for a impossible burger bun. Missed the old, but love the new. My teenage son loads up on the Korean fried chicken buns.

Like seriously, this place was TOUGH.My friends and I were in NYC for a week, we had one week to taste some of the best places NYC has to offer and this was one of them. The bulgogi bun was fire. I mean you can't really go wrong with some bulgogi unless the restaurant doesn't know what they're doing, but I promise you this joint knows what they doing. The buns were so steamy and soft, it works so well with really anything they put in between it. I'd recommend any of the buns honestly. The bulgogi was marinated just right and not overly powerful, it complimented the bun just nice. We also got the spicy fried chicken bun, and I'm from the south so we know wuzpoppin when it comes to fried chicken. You can't tell us anything bout fried chicken. Admittedly this Korean take on fried chicken was pretty good. The fried chicken was perfectly crispy and the pickled daikon just cuts through some of that fattiness and marinade that it works so well together. Tie it all together with a bun and it was FIRE. We also got the pork jowl bowl and that was just as good. Everything tasted fresh and not frozen at all. It was just a mixture of stuff and it worked together so well. From the vegetables to the pork to the rice offered so many different textures that came together amazingly. If I am ever in NYC again, I am for sure coming back to try the rest of the menu.I must say there are a few cons to this place. One being that it's very small. I can only imagine how much business they would have if it was a bigger restaurant. I do enjoy the intimate personal ambiance, but I feel bad for people that have to wait a while on a busy night. Another thing I didn't like was the price. It was a bit pricey, but keep in mind I'm not from NYC. I've had just as good or even better buns for cheaper, but the price would not deter me from eating here again. It would just stop me from eating here regularly.

My two favorite items on the menu would be their beef brisket and spare ribs. Their spare ribs is fall-off-the-bone tender and is remarkably well seasoned and marinated. It goes very well with the mac-and-cheese, which they lather into a cup (they come in three sizes). Beware -- it is incredibly filling and you may need less than you think. Their brisket always comes with the perfect lean and fat ratio. Whether you order it as a cut or in a sandwich, you will not regret it.I have had their pulled pork and lamb belly as well -- both very well done. They go great with the restaurant's hot sauce and sticky BBQ sauce.The only thing on the item that did not impress me was their sausage. Usually at BBQ joints I expect a snappy exterior and a firm bite, but the sausage here (at least the two times that I've ordered it) has a bit of a pasty texture. Still tasted great though, just not the same in terms of mouth feel. Their chicken is worth trying as well although definitely not as outstanding as the rest of their menu.The staff has always been fantastic. I don't think I've ever felt any type of negativity from them. The tall lanky dude that typically takes the orders and slices up the meat is very cordial and friendly. Did not get his name the few times I was there, but he's fantastic! There's also a bar at the front and the back of the place so lines to order drinks are never an issue! The line to order food can become quite long though, so prepare yourself. Weekends are exceptionally busy.\"),\n",

Collards were delish too but sadly no bits of pork/bacon found within the leaves (usually the best part) but I still got down with it.

It\\'s not even close, but service ruined it all.First, upon arriving to a place that serves BRUNCH, we tried to open the door at 10:50AM on a cold fall day. Getting yelled at about the opening time by the lady who greeted us at the door was an unpleasant way for us to start our outing. Why was this approach ever appropriate for people who work in a hospitality industry? No matter, we were still stoked to be there and hey, it\\'s New York so we have a tolerance for this stuff.Second, at a BRUNCH place, I made the mistake of ordering iced coffee. Waitress checked to see if they had if they had it. She claimed they did not so she brought me hot coffee. Fine. I don\\'t love hot coffee with food, so I asked for a glass of ice. The waitress then shot a glance at me, scoffs, and somebody else returns by plopping down a shaker glass with a few ice cubes in it. This could have been handled so much better. This is not an odd request. Finally, a friend of mine at the brunch called ahead of time to see if she could bring a cake for candles and if they could slice etc. On the phone, they said fine and no charge. Great! A different story when we showed up and they said it would be a $5 PER PERSON charge to slice the cake. Cool thing was that it was the same guy who told both stories to my friend. Just be up front next time. We planned around this and my friend carried a cake with her for several blocks in the cold for the occasion.

Since I had a close-by parking spot, I decided there was no harm in checking this place out. The reviews were stellar so my expectations were high.Finding this spot was easy and if you are using the MTA, Franklin Ave on the C train is your stop.As I walked in, the eatery was a bit packed so I wasn't sure if I was going to dine in or take out. The tables are situated for duo/couple dining instead of large groups. But I think a party of four can squeeze in here (if tables are available).The staff was very pleasant; he handed me a menu, told me to take my time and ask any questions if needed. I had an idea what I wanted to order and since there was a line behind me, I didn't want to start with a load of questions about what's this and that.I fell in love with the Eggplant Menemen (after viewing the pics) so that was my choice. I saw an extra table and seat by the window so I chose to hang out. And the wait for the food wasn't long at all. The Eggplant Menemen is a must try for everyone. I really love the creativity they used to make this dish. The taste was on-point; they are definitely conscious of the salt usage. I can tell the chef use alot of spices to enhance the flavor. The bread was also nicely toasted with a little burnt flavor which I loved. It looked really crunchy in the photo but it was soft and chewy.The decor is chic yet simple with its retro-inspired design. Chairs are low barstools that are light wooden in color along with the tables. You can also eat by the counter if you are able to grab one of the two/three seats. My only gripe is that this cafe is very small; I wish it was alittle bigger. I can imagine brunch hours would be busy due to the long waiting times.

We started with their pumpkin seed hummus which was topped with black sesame, sumac, and dill. I really enjoy sumac and dill, so this dish was perfect for my flavor preferences. The hummus has excellent texture; it was smooth yet not watery. The dish had a pleasant lemon flavor coming from the sumac and possible added lemon to the hummus. It's a greater starter and I'd probably go through four orders if I had a beer.Next, we shared their fried chicken sandwich with pickled cabbage and a delicious sauce. My girlfriend said it was the best chicken sandwich that see has had. Expect to see pictures of it soon on: instagram.com/adventures…The chicken was juicy and perfectly fried. It was super savory yet not a bit greasy. I loved the additional crunch from the pickled cabbage which also added very mild undertones of sourness and bitterness.All in all, the dishes were outstanding.

That kokkari dressing they put on it elevated the dish in more ways than one. This did not at all taste like the usual greasy potatoes you get from other establishments.

Pair this with the Fried Potatoes and you'll have a complete breakfast.That CHICKEN SANDWICH!!! Was delicious and I kinda wish I would've order that instead of the Smoked Trout. There is nothing wrong with the trout it's just that chicken is levels better than the trout and most chicken sandwiches period. The portions are huge and I was pleasantly surprised by the very very very generous size. The flavors are very unique and you aren't really going to find something like this anywhere else in the neighborhood. You should just go get it as soon as your done readying this.

Sunday afternoon some friends and I headed over to Glou to check out the new restaurant that just opened in Prospect Lefferts Gardens. Take note, PLG doesn't have a lot of restaurants so when a good one comes about we better do what it takes to make sure everyone knows. Like Glou for example.I walked in and was greeted by owner Jef Diesel, an absolute pleasure to dine with/at his restaurant. The interior is modern, sleek and inviting. Lots of tables, space and a lovely bar. Super large windows gives the restaurant a ton of natural light. We started with some fantastic wines and champagnes he poured for his. Also take note, he's a big wino so you can bet the wines he brings to his restaurant are top of the line stuff. From the menu you we ordered the following and I will point out the highlights.

The dishes that stood out and that's pretty much making me have weird cravings every day was the Meatballs, Wild Mushrooms, Pavlova and Tortilla Patata. The other dishes were super fantastic too but these I really really crave. The escargot was probably one of the best snails I've had to date. So simple with parsley butter, it almost makes you wonder why some places try and complicate it to the point of it being inedible.Let me tell you about those meatballs. He cooks them in a dish with burrata and parmesan and the flavours combined are everything you think paradise is made of. I am really not a fan of meatballs but these were so damn good. Like why?! The Tortilla Patatas are also super different. I've never seen anything like it and the spiced tomato jam leads it to a perfect gastronomic height. When I saw dessert was going to be Pavlova, my heart skipped a beat. I can eat meringue at any time of the day be it breakfast lunch or dinner or midnight. And his pavlova was even more perfect than I anticipated. I am so so happy Glou has opened in PLG and very much recommend this to be your next date night. You will not be disappointed.

Perfect intimate setting for a date. Their staff was very knowledgeable, particularly on their extensive wine list. The wines that we tasted were on point.Small plates we have feasted on: Escargots with parsley butter, Roasted cauliflower (favorite at the table!), wild mushrooms, spiced eggplants and the ceasar wedge. Meatball was one of their few hearty entrées as well as one of their star dishes. Overall, the food here felt unique, well balanced, with a good marriage of ingredients. For brunch, we enjoyed the perfect egg sandwich as well as the meatball sandwich. The toasted brioche bread utilized on both was decadent. The eggs were really perfect. One hiccup was the wait. About 45mn. My husband was already on his 2nd mimosa by the time our food arrived.Lastly, food portions were on the small size for the prices. Wouldn't really come here on a super hungry stomach cause all these little plates will add up.\"),\n",

About 5 dishes between two seemed sufficient, although we did order more, purely for the pleasure of eating! Highly recommend the Sardines and Meatballs, although saying that, everything we had from the menu was great. I did have some difficulty settling on a wine I liked, but, was given a few tasters to help me along the journey and finally settled on the Cote de Rhone. Thumbs up.'),\n",

       "  'This is a brand-new establishment and happens to be across the street from me. It is located right on the corner of sterling place and rogers ave, across the street from blue sky bakery.\\xa0 Previously, Oaxaca tacqueria was in the location.The small plates offered in the evening along with the wine (considering it is a wine bar) were all a little bit too experimental and complex for my tastes, simply using ingredients that were not for me. Yet, I well knew this, given that Id read the menu.Thus, when I saw they had brunch on Saturday and Sunday, I was thrilled because I was given the chance to patronize this new establishment.\\xa0 I was impressed, quickly.\\xa0 At the time we visited, there were only seven other people in the restaurant but I do not see that as a reflection of their food but more as a reflection of it\\'s newness. & it may also be impacted by the fact that a place with such a menu is atypical for the neighborhood which is largely made up of families from the West Indies. \\xa0Admittedly, I think it speaks to the slow gentrification of the meighborhood. \\xa0Overall, I do hope this restaurant/bar succeeds.We sat by the window and got an overall good look at the decor which I very much liked. For lack of better wording, I would describe it as a sort of modern rustic.\\xa0 Id love to decorate my own home similarly!\\xa0 As seen in my pictures, there is a lengthy bar as well as a good deal of tables to pick from. I absolutely adored the Edison bulb lighting they had spanning the restaurant and over all of the tables.Some of the smaller things I noticed but I noticed them because of prior experiences at other restaurants. They passed with an A+ when it came to my nit picky things .. we were immediately given water in wine-like bottle and the water was actually very CLEAN. I have been to several places where the water they provide you with has odd and questionable little specks in it so to be given some real quality water was definitely points for them.\\xa0 I also couldn\\'t help but notice the very high quality of the napkins provided AND I\\'m sure they weren\\'t cheap. I don\\'t know how to measure them in terms of ply but they were very strong and high quality. Again, points!\\xa0 Our server who I am guessing may also be the owner was very tentative and personable without being overbearing. \\xa0I have a major and Unstoppable Sweet Tooth and it always comes out at brunch. Although I absolutely adored the bread pudding dish that I ordered, it was the only sweets option on the menu. My partner ordered what I think was simply called the brunch or breakfast sandwich. It came with roasted potatoes and a tomato jam that was on the side so that you could use it to your liking. I 100% intend to brunch here again.If I had to gripe about something it would be their milk options. I know it\\'s not unusual but the only options they had were whole milk and almond milk. I do not like either of those options. \\xa0Yet, I still must say that the quality of the espresso / latte was high.Oh, & it\\'s not cheap! \\xa0I really think it may behoove them to lower their prices a bit. \\xa0Just speaking for myself, \\xa0i could see myself being a \"regular\" for brunch but due to the priciness, i will return less frequently, more as \"a treat.\" \\xa0Our bill was $41 plus tip. For 2 entrees, and 2 coffees.. not crazy or wild but at the end of the meal, i still felt some surprise.'),\n",

While we waited for a table, a couple arrived behind us and were pointed to a table. As they turned to head over, the host taps the man with menus and says, \"don\\'t forget these.\" Maybe I\\'m not milennial enough to not take note of that, but I digress.We were seated after a short wait and given menus. And then waited longer. The restaurant was busy, but not overly so, and even with staff constantly walking by no one came over to greet us. After flagging someone down, we were able to order, but had to ask twice for water.

After receiving the food, I\\'m convinced that they don\\'t know what culinary terms actually mean and are just using them to sound trendy. The cocktails are non-alcoholic, which it says on the menu but still means it\\'s not a cocktail. The Cosmo for what it was, was good, but the mango tango, which was described as a mango punch, tasted like watered down mango juice from concentrate.The panini used sliced bread and was not grilled, i.e., not a panini. The corn fritters weren\\'t fried... I think you know where I\\'m going with this*... and the \"hollandaise\" was just not. Also, the pastrami stack was ambitious but executed poorly. The sandwich was so uneven- some spots had the slaw, some had pickles, some onion ring, but never had a bite that had everything. Mysteriously, the stack was served a la carte while the steak panini came with a modest serving of roasted potatoes. The flatbread was very one note, that note being chipotle mayonnaise (it says aioli but couldn\\'t taste any garlic).All of that being said, the food wasn\\'t necessarily bad overall, at best just inconsistent and not what it was supposed to be.*side note: sauteeing fritter batter how it was done here doesn\\'t fully cook it and leaves it quite sticky.'),\n",

The decor is absolutely rustic chic with lots of plants (including a plant wall!). It definitely feels like brooklyn. You order at the counter and the waiter gives you a number to put at your table. We ordered the halloumi with eggs and the turkey bacon and chicken wrap. Both were so good! I think the wrap might have been slightly better because of the sauce and Swiss cheese in it. However, the presentation for the eggs were beautiful. I highly highly recommend getting brunch or lunch here. Can't wait to come back to try other items on the menu.\"),\n",

I might be ok with all that \"go, get it yourself\" if they were busy, but everywhere I would look around, the staff would be just standing around and talking.

The spicy harissa sauce on top has great flavor and complimented the lamb and tomatoes nicely. The french toast had a nice caramelized and crunchy exterior and a pillowy soft interior. The creme brûlée sauce on top combined with the banana and berries provided a nice sweetness without being over powering. The three eggs in hell wasn't too special in my opinion. It ended up being dominated by the vegetables inside, which were under seasoned, making the dish a little bland for me. ** on a side note, the prices here are very good, and well worth the portion sizes they give you **\"),\n",

I put that in quotes because the hostess handed us two menus and told us to sit vaguely somewhere. Our table was covered in food and water and no one came to clean it until I had already gotten napkins and started wiping it down ourselves. No one came over to take our order for 20 minutes and we had to call over a waiter after watching people seated after us get serviced first I got the Turkish Eggs and my friend got the Pastrami Stack with a side of potatoes. Like I said the food was good. Everything was delicious and our portion sizes were fair other than the side of potatoes which was about 8 potato wedges. The real problem was it was nearly another hour before we got our food. In that hour we asked three different waiters for water. All of them told us they were out of cups for some reason. This was confusing as I saw people around us drinking coffee out of plastic cups and the baristas were making drinks in cups. It was 85 degrees, there was no air conditioning and no one would give us water. The girls at the table next to us complained about this to their waiter and asked to speak to the manager. The manager is incidentally also the chef and one of two people in the kitchen. So this whole water fiasco slowed down the kitchen greatly and as you can imagine we were pretty impatient to get our food. None of the waitstaff were helpful at all, most were unsympathetic and unhelpful when we were asking for water or to even order our foodMy friend who brought me loves this place and says on weekdays it\\'s great to visit.

All of a sudden he snaps and say he doesn't have time to go down the list and go line up at the counter if we wanted to order drinks. We were like ok then water is fine. I overheard him complaining to the barista while I was on line to order my drinks. It's funny how he has time to stand around for a good 15 minutes gossiping with the barista but no time to do his job. We waited more than half an hour to receive our lattes and food. It does not take that long to make a latte. To top it off, he never brought us our water while other tables were served water. When I went to ask about what is the hold up. They immediately brought out our drinks after. We were presented with very sloppy spilled lattes. Finally our food arrived after a good 45 minutes. The food was good and the cooks were hardworking. The other waiters and waitresses were decent. I don't understand what is with this particular waiter of ours. He doesn't want us to waste his time but okay to do that to us. I see other reviewers complaining about the same guy. Seriously, he needs to be let go or else he'll continue to drag down the reputation of this establishment. Oh did I mention about how he presented us the credit card payment machine. He stucked it out for us to slide the card and looks the other way like he's irritated. Even the couple next to our table picked up on his rude negative vibes through the whole time. Basically, when the food arrived we just wanted to finish our meal quickly to get out of there. We did not have time to enjoy our meal. We weren't even rude to him for him to behave like that in the beginning.

       "  'SoCo is SoSo in regards to customer service. I\\'ve patronized this establishment twice & my first experience over the summer was much better than my more recent experience while in town for Christmas 2013. On my first visit I was more than excited to experience SoCo due to the numerous e-mails I\\'d received from their Mother restaurant /my Original favorite restaurant in NYC \"Negril Village\". This enthusiasm deterred my aggravation while waiting for a table for more than a hour at 9:00pm (which is WAY past my dinnertime). Once we were seated we sipped on Pear Cider which is awesome and easy to overdue by drinking too many. Though it took over 90 minutes to be seated I was happy with dinner from the apps to the main course. We had mussels as an app to share and another person had the ShortRib flatbread pizza to share which everyone who are meat eaters and they all loved it. I had the Salmon over mashed sweet potatoes and it was amazing, definitely worth the wait.Let\\'s get to my more recent visit which was the visit from HELL. I made reservations this go round because it was the weekend after Christmas and we were a party of 8. The best part about this visit was that we were seated immediately at the table that is elevated over the restaurant straight to the back. We had a waitress come over to the table by the name of TASHA remember that name and be sure to NEVER have her as your waitress EVER especially if you have people in your party that she may have liked or may have crushed on and didn\\'t get any play. This young lady was very short with us and we were in the Christmas spirit and sharing our Holiday cheer. We were ordering our apps and drinks and when some was trying to tell her \"That\\'s 7 Pear ciders\" she quickly replied \"WAIT HOLD UP, one person at a time\". That\\'s not so bad you say, however you had to see her FACE of disgust like she didn\\'t want to be there or be our server. I shared my phone with her to show her that I checked in on Yelp and I unlocked the Yelp offer for cornbread which she looked at and shunned my phone back over to me \" My Gold Iphone 5s\" REALLY. I continued to maintain my composure and began fellowshipping with my group as we waited on our drinks and apps. About 15 minutes later some of the drinks came and one of the 5 apps. Another 20 minutes later we flagged her down and she decided to bring the rest of the apps (COLD) and we inquired about the cornbread and she rolled her eyes and walked away. NOTE:We didn\\'t get the cornbread until after our entrees were served. We ordered our entrees again after flagging her down and practically begging her to come over to our table and help us as we were hungry. This young lady TASHA was THEE worst waitress I\\'ve ever had in NYC and I know that NYC is known to be cut throat or rude however I\\'m from Chicago so I know a thing or two about ignorance and how to handle it as well as how to offset it in a NICE/NASTY way.Icing on the cake: Tasha came by to clear the table without asking us if we were done with our plates or even asking if she could clear the table, she just started grabbing stuff and we had to pull plates out of her hand that we were still working on and one item in particular that she removed was the cheesecake and in the process the cheesecake feel onto the Chanel leather glove of one of the ladies at the table and you would think TASHA would acknowledge this mess with not just a look but an apology and a swift sprint to grab something to clean the glove off. Ooh NO, Tasha kept clearing the table while everyone looked with wide-eyes except me as I just can\\'t tolerate IGNORANCE and DISRESPECT for any reason for so long. I stated \"Excuse me, you just dropped cheesecake on her glove\" and she gave me this LOOK as if she was trying to CUT my throat with her eyes and walked away and came back and dropped a napkin on the table on top of the glove and walked away. She returned to drop the check and once I grabbed the check and noticed that her tip was about $85 automatically I immediately asked for a manager. My ISSUE: The manager listened to the table express a group consensus of how rude TASHA was from start to finish. No one asked to not pay the tip; we just ask that it be redirected to the kitchen for the amazing food and to the dishwashers as the dishes were clean and sparkling. We REFUSE to give her a dime; however the manager sugar coated her actions and made it seem like she may have been having a bad day as if it was acceptable for her to express her bad day toward individuals patronizing this establishment and spending a large chunk of change. The SAD part is that I\\'m sure nothing was done and she received that tip because he seemed pretty sweet on her and compassionate for her regardless of her actions which is why I have no plans on no visits to NYC to see family to patronize this establishment again or no plans to add SoCo to my list of places to try for those who look to me for travel advice due to my extensive travels.'),\n",

Ambiance- Soco is very lively with a DJ playing music and even the people working there were feeling the music. It is very astounding how music makes people connect in ways they could not imagine. Service- This is where it got a little choppy. We had a very enthusiastic server, but the people delivering our food often times went to the wrong table. They almost gave away our Mimosa drinks! Having said that, the food came very quick... speaking of. Food- Very tantalizing. I loved the taste of my Chicken. As did my wife. She had her Lobster Shrimp and Grits. I had my allergies so she got to eat two meals (Grumbles) Red velvet was definitely a mouthful but it is just enough not to make your mouth dry. I Really enjoyed it. Such a great concept of Chicken & Red velvet waffles. Price- This is also a chippy thing. I cannot possibly justify spending what we spent on a regular occurrence. You would have to be at a special event ( Like... a birthday ;D) to feel good about some of the pricing. You can just as easily enjoy the meals at other establishments for half of what we paid.

The sweet butter that was served with the cornbeard was really good. The mussels were a good serving. The sauce was good but I felt it was missing flavor. The creaminess over powered any seasoning that was in the mussels. For my entree I had the steak and eggs and my spouse had the sweet potato pancakes. I ordered my steak medium well and it came as much but the steak was tough. The au jour that came with the steak had such good flavor and complimented the steak and eggs. The sweet potato pancakes WERE THE BOMB. They were fluffy but had a nice little crisp on the outside. The blueberries and whipped cream complimented the pancakes so well.

The ambiance on this rainy night was chill, the music was funky/r&b and a little soft rock which wasn't too loud which sometimes it can be, the candle light I think is what makes this place cool to be also \\xa0it's not to dark or dim for me personally Drinks: I started with an Espolon and lime juice with club soda and my only complaint is I'm not sure they use fresh lime juice and it totally changed the flavor of the cocktail. My friend had a daiquiri and wasn't excited about it either. After him ordering a beer I switched to a hot toddy and it was sooooooo good and the cup was super cute. Food: Our server was Cleo she was super informative and helpful, we started with the chips & guac, yucca croquettes and a side of fries. I love shoe string fries so they won my heart there, the guac was served with an extremely spicy sauce but it was also really good and the yucca croquettes never disappoint.For a main entree my friend ordered the special which was a mushroom risotto with scallops. I ordered the Short Rib Cannelloni. The photos are how the dishes came out served, the risotto as great and my dish was fine not as good as what I usually get which is the three mushroom pappardelle entree but not bad. The amount of greens on the plate just felt rushed but I don't mind veggies. Overall the food was pretty good! Desserts: I have never had Ice Cream Profiteroles and I'm still thinking about them so so good ! The flourless chocolate cake was also amazing and I was way too full to finish it but I loved it none the less ! The crème anglaise was the secret star of the dessert in my opinion.

Went here Wednesday night around 8 with five other friends. \\xa0We sat at our usual spot by the window and the restaurant wasn\\'t packed at this time but it had a good amount of people. There was one server and one bartender on staff. Server was friendly enough, but seemed new. No matter, she remembered all of the things we ordered and we ordered a lot! We started with apps, 3 orders of the yucca croquettes, 2 chicken arepas, and 2 orders of the tamarind calamari. For drinks, i was super excited that they had a hot drink with chocolate and chili so i opted for that. My friends had margaritas.The apps cane out pretty quick. As usual, the yucca croquettes were delicious. My favorite dish of the entire night. They are highly recommended! The arepas were a no for me. I took a small half and even that was too much, but I\\'ve also never had an arepa and have nothing to compare it to. The calamari was a big soggy. I think they used a bit too much tamarind and it kinda clashed with the texture, but i enjoyed it nonetheless. As for the drinks...i hated the hot chocolate drink. The alcohol overpowered the entire drink, and the chili felt like a kick in the face. It was subtly like i expect from my Mexican chocolate drinks. \\xa0My friends, however enjoyed their margaritas.This is when things got a bit sticky. After the apps our waiter disappeared. 20 minutes later, and still nothing. There were about three more groups that came in during this time so i kind of gave her some slack as she was alone. The wait became a bit annoying after this, we were out of drinks and water too so we were all feeling antsy. I asked her if i could switch my drink for the margarita which she seemed a little annoyed by but i barely touched it. I even added simple syrup to try to make it drinkable.Dinner arrives finally! I got the pumpkin soup which was ok. It was kind of sweet and the cheese was good but too much was overwhelming. My friend ordered the pasta which he devoured. The remaining dishes were the special, all i remember was my friend being really upset because his food was \"soggy\". Last dishes were the soba noodles with seafood. That dish was kinda weird.

Again, the atmosphere just seemed very bland in here as I think someone else noted; there's no real vibe and it's just not very interesting. It's too sterile maybe? Already knowing the $11 menu price upon completion of my drink I had the bartender my card to close out and she walks away and then returns to tell me that there is a $20 minimum and asks me if I have cash. Surprisingly I actually do, and as I was annoyed, i decided to not argue and just pay it but I first ask how much just out of habit whenever I hand over cash. She tells me $12. Confused, I hand her $15 and she returns with my $3 change and sets it on the bar. I assume she wasn't expecting me to tip so she added the extra $1 to the price?? Nevertheless, I take $2 off the bar and leave knowing that I'll never set foot in this place again. \\xa0There's too many other great places with better energy in the neighborhood to patronize. \\xa0If you hate interacting with locals and only want to meet other transplants to Brooklyn then this is the perfect place for you to go and feel like you're somewhere else.

They give you corn tortillas to go with it, so you can make your own cheesy tacos, which was interesting, although I would have preferred tortilla chips (making the DIY queso tacos was more labor intensive than I had really wanted).

We asked about combining-- guacamole and salsa with chips... No dice $16 so we ordered it with single chips. It wasn't salsa it was 3 different hot sauces. California Cats know salsa is tomato, onion, and peppers (and other Mexican restaurants in NYC and Brooklyn know).FoodWe both ordered tacos. My companion: 2 carnitas and I: 1 carnitas and 1 pescado.

       "  'Win Son is a Taiwanese restaurant that\\'s opened up in the borderlands of Bushwick and Williamsburg. It\\'s a few minutes off the L-train. I went there at the suggestion of Samuel B., fantasy league sociopath, who recommended it. Met up with him plus league staples Kyle N. and John A. (commissioner profiled in the Washington Post)It\\'s a small \"artisanal\" menu split between appetizers and entrees. We had the cucumber salad, eggplant, turnip cake, claims & basil (incl. scallion pancake), and pork buns for appetizers, plus mullet roe noodles, beef rolls, and something else that I forgot. The only \"bust\" was the cucumber salad, which felt like something you could easily make at home and that depended less on a creative recipe than the intrinsic tastes of the cucumber itself.Win Son allows you the choice of sitting outside or inside, and if it\\'s a nice day, I definitely recommend the former option. It\\'s not because I necessarily love being outdoors. On the contrary, see my Las Veganization of the world sudden-death climate change strategy plan where we will all have to live in bubbles but get to watch Lady Gaga and Cirque du Soleil shows all day. But the inside of Win So is awful. Sadly, like many restaurant, it\\'s taken the advice that loud pulsating \"club\" music is desirable. It really impedes paced eating and conversation. Were we inside, I would have given this place a flat 3, maybe even 2 star, rating. That\\'s how bad it is. If you want a club, go to Live 1OAK or Catch or whatever.Final note: Samuel B. had me thinking Win Son was a hole-in-the-wall place with bad decor and suspect sanitary standards that served delicious food. It\\'s not. It\\'s incredibly well manicured, and it made me wonder whether the place is truly owned by actual Taiwanese/Asian proprietors. BZZZ!!!... no. It\\'s run by one \"Trigg Brown.\" This raises a perennial question here: is this cultural appropriation to be lamented or cultural syncretism to be celebrated? We debated it as a group, and we settled on the latter, though not without some unease. I personally was finally swayed when I recalled that my favorite Peking duck joints in NYC are all owned by people who don\\'t look like me. John A. said that the best pizza shops are owned by Albanians, and as an Italian, he doesn\\'t take offense. Ultimately, with so much hardening of borders in today\\'s society, what\\'s the harm of a little cultural fusion?'),\n",

We were the third party to be seated.My party of three got the cucumber salad, guohua street salad, clams & basil, flys head, and the sesame noodles. We also got two Taiwanese beers since it was $3 during HH.Food came quickly. Here's the breakdown:Cuke salad: 6.8/10 it was topped with fried garlic and cilantro. I think the dish could have been colder. The flavor was good but the cukes were too limp and room temp.Guohua salad: 8/10 it's a salad with shrimp and ripe mango, large leaves of mint and basil. This was the best dish of the night... just because it was the least saltiest. It was a good salad. The base seemed to be cabbage.Clams & basil: 6.8/10 this comes with a whole scallion pancake to dip in. I loves clams drowning in gravy. This was exactly that. First bite was amazing. Salty but good. However, as you keep eating this dish, the salt just overwhelms you. If you get this, get a refreshing veggie side dish to offset the heaviness.Flys head: 7/10 this is the dish I was most excited for. I saw a munchies video on the chefs of win son and flys head seemed so unique. It's a ton of garlic chives with pieces of pork shoulder. The dish was good... but again very salty. It actually kind of tasted like what a pork and chive dumpling would taste like, minus the outside peel. Kind of underwhelming. They give you a bowl of rice to top it over.Sesame noodles: 6.7/10 I though this would taste like Dan Dan noodles but it was not peanutty nor sesame-y. It tasted like the Korean black bean noodle dish... but salty. You getting the theme of this restaurant? LolI love Pine & Crane and joy in LA. It's a hipsters take on Taiwanese food. I think they nailed it perfectly. Win Son.... I think it doesn't quite reach that level. They need to tone down on the salt in case you didn't get that from my review lolParking was relatively easy.

The Pan Seared Dumplings are basically xiaolongbao that was pan grilled so you got an additional crunch texture to the softness of the skin and silkiness of the soup. But also that sauce was AMAZING! Packed so full of flavor and if you add their chili oil to that, that's just amazinggg.I liked their version of the Lu Rou Fan! It was a good amount of toppings for the amount of rice they gave and the toppings themselves were very good. But I wish they gave us more sauce because in the end, I felt like I needed more to accompany the amount of rice that was given. I was a little disappointed by the Dan Zi Mian. I felt like they added a bit too much fish sauce so it tasted quite fishy... otherwise the noodles were cooked perfectly and the condiments in that dish were wonderful!I would definitely come back here for Taiwanese Fusion food!

This is slightly upscale fusion done right by Asian Americans who obviously love and understand the entirety of their culinary toolbox.滷肉飯 and 蚵仔煎 are Taiwanese classics, and Win Son's versions are worth the premium. The 滷肉飯 comes with a stewed egg: mix the gooey yolk into the rice with the pork for a treat. Like almost everything else here, it's topped with an almost-excessive pile of scallions and garlic chips, which add snap and crunch in addition to flavor. The rice is cooked right, and the pork is rich and tender. The 蚵仔煎 here comes plated with a swirl of green sauce that tastes like pesto. The egg doesn't have as much potato starch mixed in as some other places do, making it less slimy. The oysters are plump and briny accents in the slightly-smoky egg. They also don't do the sweet red sauce that usually comes with 蚵仔煎, which is fine by me because I'm not such a fan of the sauce.The 生煎包 are small, but the ratio of skin to filling is spot on. Each bite yields a combination of crisped bottom skin, chewy top skin, rich pork, and soup. They're not as juicy as your typical 小籠包, but it was definitely a nice touch.The vegetables here aren't quite as strong. The eggplant is nicely crisped on the outside while being soft and melty inside, but the sugar overwhelms the other flavors, even the copious amount of peanut powder costing the whole dish. The pea shoots are fine, but not quite as juicy or crisp as they could be, and the garlic chips on top can't quite make up for a slight lack of garlic flavor in the actual vegetables.\"),\n",

Everything here honestly was needlessly expensive and pretentious, and was incredibly hard to share with a large group. In trying to elevate these already wonderful food items this place has essentially defiled these traditional dishes with weird ingredients that for the most part do not work well with each other. There were however two standout dishes that i thought would serve better as just appetizers as opposed to main menus, the big chicken bao and the oyster omelette. Big chicken bao the chicken was seasoned incredibly well, super tender and moist and the generous helping of what i assume to be made from scratch mayo worked incredibly well with the crunchiness of the chicken. Oyster omelette was amazing the sweetness of both the sauce and the basil aoli paired really well! the fresh basil combined with the basil aoli gave this dish a super strong slap of basil which left an incredibly pleasant aroma and taste as i bit into this item. These two items kind of redeemed this place as they were really top notch, otherwise this place is a skip in my opinion since most of these dishes are just appetizers, most of the items fall short and some of the most iconic Taiwanese dishes are just left out completely\"),\n",

I understand the place is casual, but they charge regular restaurant prices, not fast food prices. As I said, nothing about the place was terrible, it was all just very average. YMMV.'),\n",

       "  'This spot has been on my foodie list for quite some time and I finally mustered up some free time to try it out. First things first - I must admit, I had high expectations which might\\'ve led to my disappointment. Before going, I read a few reviews to mentally prepare myself. Many of the reviews referenced the crab cake sliders and lucky for us, it was a Thursday and there happened to be specials on Thursday where you could select 3 menu item specials for $20. This sold me. So we headed to Crabby Shack. I knew it was a small restaurant, but surprisingly enough, we went around 8:45 ish on a Thursday and it wasn\\'t packed at all. We quickly found a table (and parking wasn\\'t too bad either!). Upon entering, the cashier advised we could take a menu to our seats and then could order up front after reviewing the menu. The menu wasn\\'t too descriptive, so of course I had some questions. I approached the cashier and asked her how it worked, did you order the seafood as a base and then add sauce?! She totally disregarded me and said... \"just tell me what you want and I\\'ll explain after. \" I told her what I wanted ... and she never explained?! I ordered 1 lb. of the Alaskan snow crab and 1/2 lb. of spicy steamed shrimp. My main question was how would they be served? She didn\\'t ask if we wanted it sauced. I then proceeded to order a side of cornbread and an appetizer of the crab cake sliders. Initially, before putting in the order and while reviewing the menu, I noticed the Thursday special wasn\\'t listed on the menu as referenced on yelp. However, there is a sign by the cashier. When I asked the cashier about it, she said the soup was sold out. I asked if we could get two crab cakes in lieu of the soup + another item on the specials list and she said no and quickly moved the sign. Not sure why they couldn\\'t substitute a remaining side of the soup sold out, or at least honor it since the sign was there?! THE FOOD: The crab cakes were decent. The buns were soft and my favorite part. The crab cake itself was tasty, but for two tiny sliders ... not worth $16 in my humble opinion. The Alaskan crab, as I presumed came in a clear bag sauced. I was confused because I didn\\'t know it came sauced up, I wish I could\\'ve chosen a sauce for it to be sauced in. Nonetheless - decent. Not sure if it was worth $27, the sauce was lacking in taste and not much in the bag for the big snow crab legs to soak up. The spicy steamed shrimp was good. I enjoyed the sauce. The cornbread was cold when it was served,I\\'m sure it would\\'ve been tasty if served warm. The cornbread went really well with the spicy sauce that came with the steamed shrimp. The iced tea was decent, although the woman at the front forgot to give it to us and then proceeded to tell us that we didn\\'t pay for it, when we did? We eventually got it after telling her we did in fact pay for it... and then realized it wasn\\'t even really worth it, as it wasn\\'t even cold, it was almost like a warm tea? Would\\'ve been tasty if cooled! Overall: 2.5/5, but yelp doesn\\'t allow for it. Glad I knocked it off my bucket list. Side note: they\\'re a little pricey - everything came up to about $70 (1 lb. Alaskan snow crab legs; 1/2 lb. spicy steamed shrimp; 1 side order of cornbread - which literally consisted of one slice of (cold) cornbread; 1 order of crab cake sliders - basically 2 (super)mini crab cake burgers; and 1 iced tea).'),\n",

I can't fault restaurants for doing that per se, but if that's a problem, then don't take reservations. That's just guesswork, but the takeaway is that our seating left a lot to be desired, and there were better options.Speaking of the kitchen, it was slow. Which would be fine if the food was worth the wait, and sadly, it wasn't - my steak was unevenly cooked.

       "  \"So I had the pleasure of dining at this AMAZING establishment. Which is located in the heart of Bed Stuy. It is a family operated restaurant, a mother and her children cooking grandmas recipes. The decor is so Dope feels like a contemporary vintage design. The backyard is beautiful I can see plenty of nice summer meals here. Now the food is on a different level, and it is definitely cooked with love as well as passion. Everything on the menu is cooked fresh no microwaves in the kitchen. I love it, felt like a proper home cooked meal was being prepared for my family and myself. They start you off with delicious cornbread. OMG!!! My wife had the catfish with a side of potato salad and collard greens. When I tell you they cook with love and flavorful seasoning. They truly do. Now myself had the lamb chops, just writing this review is making my mouth all watery. I had plenty of lamb chops from many fine restaurants but none with flavor as they did at Cheri's. I also had the mac n cheese with a side of mixed vegetables. Yummy is all I can say. You can feel the love from every last bite and see the love amongst the family was just as cool. There are not many establishments I give a 5-star review too. But Cheri's Bed Stuy has now joined my 5-star list of restaurants that are a must. So kudos to you for making yummy food and cooking with LOVE!!\"),\n",

First thing that caught my eyes when I walked in was the art surrounding the walls. The beautiful paintings and the dim lighting provided a nice little ambience. We were given the option to sit in or outside. We initially sat outside and it\\'s a nice setup back there. Very clean and well maintained. Unfortunately, the mosquitos were out in full force so we decided to be reseated inside. Our server, Yasmine, was very accommodating of that. She was also very nice and attentive. She made sure we had any and everything we needed and kept us up to date on the status of our orders. Speaking of our orders, the food did take a little longer to come out than I would have liked. It wasn\\'t a tremendous wait time, but just long enough to have me wondering \"ok. Where\\'s the food at?\" But once it came out, it was well worth the wait. Freshly made grits and eggs. Freshly made shrimp and fish. It was all so delicious. I highly recommend giving this spot a try if you\\'re in the neighborhood.'),\n",

The shrimp and grits were phenomenal, but the red velvet waffles and chicken were surprisingly not as edible as I had liked it to be. First off, I came for brunch, not dessert and chewing the red velvet waffles was like biting into a red velvet cupcake. There was no waffle crunch and it was totally soft and doughy! Then, I bit into the hearty chicken and it was like kissing my best friend-- no chemistry whatsoever! I felt nothing. What happened to the flavor... the seasoning... the excitement of biting into comfort food?? I don\\'t even eat fried chicken on a regular anymore and was slightly irritated I used my very limited set of fried chicken meal credits for this! Ahhh...The shrimp and grits are among my top 5 in bed stuy. Why? Because the shrimp is well flavored and the grits were the PERFECT texture and savory flavor with a hint of sweet.I demand equality of meal quality! Why is the shrimp and grits so good but the red velvet chicken and waffles barely got any love and nurturing of flavor in the kitchen?I would come back just for shrimp and grits but taking a chance on dinner or any other menu items feels a bit risky.'),\n",

If you don't have a place to be then take the time to eat here but if you are a little impatient when it comes to timely food service. This is not your place. They did bring us a piece of their signature cornbread for waiting so I always think that shows good service. When my food did come I wasn't the most impressed. I ordered the chicken and waffles and the waffles were good but I wasn't the most impressed with the chicken. I like the vibe of the place so I hope some of the kinks this place has get resolved.

So About the Space: Cheri's is serving a vintage vibe with an exposed brick wall with paintings around. It's mostly comprised of small two seat tables that can be pushed together, a taller picnic style bar table, and the large square table in the love-shack corner. The love shack corner is almost cozy but the seats are cut a lil too narrow which isn't a problem if you have a narrow behind. Ambiance: The music should always stay loud enough to hear because the play lists have been on point every time we were there! Play on, playas.So About the Food: Anyone counting calories: don't eat all day if you're going because a) the cornbread b) the Mac and cheese and I NEVER do Mac and cheese but this one must have had some addictive substance in it (lol) because the aroma drove me to taste...and keep tasting, the Greens, the... lemme stop before I name the whole menu. Everything I had and everything my friends had was amazing. Only two considerations on the food: portion size on the delectable catfish... maybe I was fortunate those times I went to Peaches HotHouse and Shrimp and Crab because those catfish portion sizes were a blessing. Next consideration- I'm an extremely low salt/low sodium person so I might be hyper-sensitive but the salmon croquettes seemed just a touch salty. But TRY them because my less sensitive to salt friend loved them. What's missing: More art, more images, spoke word and live performances and YOU.

       "  'This is in my \"hidden gem\" category of Brooklyn restaurants. You can find a lot of great Dominican comfort food here with recipes that you can\\'t find in other Caribbean restaurants. This makes the place great for a Dominican brunch.One thing to note about Puerto Viejo is it takes a lot of pride in their hot sauce. In fact occasionally they will setup stalls in food festivals promoting their sauce and selling it. It\\'s actually through one of these stalls I found about this place. The sauce itself is fairly a fairly good scotch bonnet sauce and they give you it when your food comes out. Though its a Caribbean sauce its quite hot so be warned!Not only is their sauce good but Puerto Viejo also has great Dominican food. The first time I was here was for their brunch when I had one of their mangú dishes and their oatmeal drink. I never had either of these but I loved them. I love plantains in general so I like that it is staple to a lot of the food here. When I was here with friends I also had the Ox Tail Stew which was fantastic. I think everyone at our table enjoyed their food a lot.The interior of Puerto Viejo is quite interesting and gives off a rustic Caribbean beach shack vibe. You will see barrels holding up furniture, walls made of both wood and metal sheets, and wooden chairs/tables. They claim that the furniture is recycled from local industries or something. It is quite memorable and I would argue makes the restaurant feel more laid-back. Puerto Viejo is \"the bomb\" as one of my Caribbean friends said about the place. The only real complaint I have about this place is that they don\\'t take credit card but cash only.'),\n",

There are a few things that this restaurant does right, like the pastel en hoja, shrimp empanada (do not order the chicken empanada... it\\'s not good), and the red beans, but that is not enough to carry a meal out of subpar status. There are just too many things that Puerto Viejo does wrong (and must be fixed) before I can feel comfortable giving a higher rating and recommending this place... I will elaborate below:For starters, PLEASE change up the recipe for your jugo natural (especially the chinola and Tamarindo ones). I love jugo de chinola and jugo de tamarindo, but the juice at Puerto Viejo tastes like chemicals.... there is NO WAY this juice can accurately be labeled as \"natural\" fruit juice- it\\'s gross.Secondly, the rabo guisado (oxtail dish) needs some serious work. The way Dominicans usually make rabo is \"encendio,\" but the oxtail dish at this restaurant definitely lacks a lot of flavor. It tastes like the meat was boiled for a few hours and served. Not a hint or whisper of seasoning to be found.Lastly, if you\\'re going to call something a \"chimi burger\" make sure it is actually a Dominican Chimi and not a regular hamburger. I was extremely disappointed when I ordered this dish the first time I came here and realized that it was not a chimi. Those are just a few suggestions on how this place can make amends. I really want to love Puerto Viejo, but until they switch things up I won\\'t come back.'),\n",

Probably around 40 minutes. When our food came out, it looked amazing... until I started cutting into it. My filet mignon was not medium rare - it was basically rare. It was so rare that I could barely taste anything. The thing is, my boyfriend's wagyu burger wasn't medium rare, it was medium well. I have no idea how the chef managed to mess both of them up. After eating half of my burger, I decided I might as well talk to the waiter about it. I flagged him down and notified him that it was a little too rare for my taste, and he brought it back to the kitchen. I waited... another 20 minutes for my burger to come back. I noticed that my onions on the side were gone :( but I literally just devoured the rest because I was so hungry.

The tableside prep of the tartare was very nice, and it tasted AMAZING- probably my favorite bite of the meal apart from those craveable lotus chips they gave us! The steak was cooked as asked, a nice medium rare, and came with a variety of sauces that we all used to flavor it to our liking. The table favorite was the soy lemon sauce- it was almost all gone when we finished the steak! The porterhouse for two with a side was definitely enough for three people with an appetizer. We also got the broccoli, which although the hollandaise was nice, wasn't really noteworthy. The service here was really nice and accommodating- refilling drinks/water/chips as needed as we waited for our steak, and not rushing us out afterwards.

We got the portion for 2 ($150) which comes with 6 3-inch slices of meat (about 2-3 bites per slice) so it's small but it is so packed with flavor, so rich and buttery, that if you get some sides or appetizers you should be satisfied. Wagyu comes from cows bred in japan that are fed a special diet and raised so that they have a high fat content that is intermuscular/marbled within the muscle which creates a texture and taste unlike any other steak. Every bite of meat is like butter with a seared crisp on the outside. I don't know how else to describe it. We also got the wagyu sushi which was my favorite. The matcha cake was good too.

       "  'I was sorely disappointed in my trip to Sweet Chick. I had been so excited to go, so on a trip up from DC, it was my first priority. First off, it\\'s vastly overpriced for the portions. The specialty alcoholic drinks are $13 and served in child-sized glasses. A sweet tea cost my friend $5, no refills of course. But the kicker was when I ordered the grilled wings appetizer. My mouth dropped when the waiter brought it to the table...I couldn\\'t help but look around and wonder if I was being punk\\'d. In front of me were three of the scrawniest, driest wings I had ever seen. (Please see the attached pic.) AND THEY COST $11. I\\'ll give them this--the flavor was good. Too bad there was no real meat to taste them on. I mean, really, wtf. I ordered a side of collard greens with them ($7, but that\\'s not too abnormal for a side dish) that was decent. I wasn\\'t mad at them and would eat them again, but I don\\'t think I\\'d pay more than $5 for the amount served.My friends were similarly disappointed with their meals and drink orders. One did the wings and elotes, one did the catfish (which she said tasted like dirt) and the buffalo chicken bucket (which she said was dry and tasted old), and they split a side of mac and cheese, which they both said was \"just ok.\" They ended up sending all their food back.What was especially upsetting is that when we asked to speak to the manager and talked about a) the freshness of the food, b) the quality of the food, and c) the portion sizes, the manager had the audacity to say to us, \"Well this isn\\'t a Popeye\\'s drive thru.\" !!! The gall! Sir, if this was a Popeye\\'s, I would\\'ve been satisfied with my order. This most certainly is NOT a Popeye\\'s drive thru, but I wish it had been. I am trying to resist saying that that comment was racial in tone because it was said to three black women by a white man, but f* it, I just did. Nobody would insinuate to white people that they\\'re used to eating at fast food places and can\\'t understand the difference between a drive thru and a sit-down restaurant.After our complaints and our lack of eating, you\\'d think the manager would offer to comp our drinks and/or food, make us something else, or at the very least, apologize. None of the above happened, and we were delivered a check for $128 for nearly inedible food. My first thought was to leave without paying, but I\\'m an adult, so I paid for this terrible meal and, after this review, will put the bad experience out of my mind.I must say as a disclaimer: The actual price of the food wasn\\'t the problem. I am from and live in DC, where prices are exactly the same, but VALUE is high. No one balked at the prices of the food or drinks until they were brought out. I feel like I need to say that before someone thinks that my party and I were being cheap or were unaccustomed to city prices...anyone who has been to DC knows that nothing here is cheap.If you were looking forward to trying Sweet Chick, don\\'t go to this one. This is the only location I\\'ve been to, so I can\\'t vouch for the others, but I can definitively say THIS is not the one.'),\n",

The waffles come with three types of butter (lemon, cherry, herb) which were great for that savory/sweet element on the egg, ham waffle. Based on the hype around Sweet Chick, I was a bit disappointed that the chicken was a bit over cooked and the flavor from the gravy on the skin wasn't my favorite. The waffle was perfectly fine but for a $21 dish, it did not deliver - especially knowing this place is supposed to specialize in their fried chicken. I did enjoy the shrimp and grits more, the grits were cheesy, flavorful, and had the perfect texture and the shrimp were cooked perfectly.Overall, a bit hesitant to return knowing their chicken was underwhelming but they have other dishes that seem more interesting and well executed.

We really didn\\'t care about the drinks but his whole attitude was unnecessary and petty and ridiculous but anyway we generally love this place we haven\\'t been in weeks this guy is new so don\\'t let him stray you away.

       "  \"after preparing myself for a long wait based on all these yelp reviews, we got to peaches hothouse around 6:45ish on a saturday and were delighted to be sat immediately. i will say this location is very small, not that great for large groups, and that there was a substantial amount of people waiting outside by 7pm. so definitely get here a little early if you want to avoid a wait. i got the hot fried chicken with mac and cheese, which also comes with a square of cornbread and some sweet pickles. i loved the spice mix they used on the chicken, which was very hot and had a subtle, sweet note as well. the hot chicken is definitely not for the faint of heart. i have a pretty high spice tolerance, and my mouth was on fire. i wish they had a spice level between regular and 'hot' because i will say that the spiciness was borderline distracting. but so good. but somewhat painful. i will say it looks like they're inconsistent with how much spice goes on the chicken -- the girls at the table next to us also ordered the hot chicken, but ours definitely had a lot more spice mix on it. the pickles were crisp and delicious, and cut through some of the spiciness. the mac and cheese was also so good!!! it came out hot, and the cheesy sauce was very smooth (what's up with all the grainy mac and cheeses out there lately? who is into this stuff?). the cornbread was pretty dry, nothing to write home about. for drinks, we got the sweet georgia brown (bourbon and sweet tea), which was awesome and also helped cool my mouth in between bites of chicken.i'm actually surprised to see so many complaints about the service -- maybe we were just lucky, but our waiter was very attentive, and took our food and drink orders very quickly. and the food came out in record time! don't think we waited more than 5 minutes for our meal. they also played a lot of old school rap here, which my boyfriend appreciated and wanted to note in this review (2 chainz, biggie, snoop dogg, more that i forgot probably).\"),\n",

       "  \"so i went here the other day, tuesday (9-24-19) for what turned out to be a surprise dinner for my up and coming birthday and was pleased. before coming here, i had seen this restaurant on television a few days prior on one of the food networks and mentioned how i would like to go here and so to me surprise, ended up here. now i would advise before going here to make reservations because even on a tuesday night, this place gets crowded to where a line is waiting outside of the establishment. due to not having a reservation, we had to actually wait until they gave us the option to eat outside where a few tables were available. one of the things that surprised us was how attentive our waiter was towards his customers, he really showed interest. enough of that, you want to know what we had and here it is. we ordered the connecticut which is a buttered lobster roll which comes with a few different side options such as fries in which i chose, a baked potato, spinach and others. the lobster roll was pretty good but it comes only buttered and not with the mayonnaise and celery and other goods that you are used to seeing on lobster rolls. we also had the crab dip in which we saw on the show was well liked and highly suggested but unfortunately when we had it, it was first too salty to the point where we had to have our waiter take it back and when the new one came around, it lacked salt and a bit of flavor and the chips it came with was wrong for it due to it being too burnt and with old bay seasoning. oh well, i guess you win some and you lose some. we had these fried oysters with spinach on top which was an interesting mix together which was only okay, not the best and probably due to the spinach being too strong. the star of the night and the last dish that we had was the 1.5 pound lobster which was huge for a 1.5 pounder and even could have passed for a 2 pounder. this lobster was cooked perfectly and tasted great and best of all was fresh! a lot of the times when you go to seafood restaurants, the seafood doesn't always taste as fresh as it should but here, that wasn't a problem. the lobster came with potatoes, and sausage in which we had the option in adding. the sausage in which they used was good too. as for the price, this place isn't cheap so if you are looking for a cheapy but goodie, this isn't it! these items plus 4 glasses of wine ran us to about 150. overall, i'd definitely go to here again and on a scale from 1 to 10, i'd give it an 7.5.\"),\n",

       "  'soco is soso in regards to customer service. i\\'ve patronized this establishment twice & my first experience over the summer was much better than my more recent experience while in town for christmas 2013. on my first visit i was more than excited to experience soco due to the numerous e-mails i\\'d received from their mother restaurant /my original favorite restaurant in nyc \"negril village\". this enthusiasm deterred my aggravation while waiting for a table for more than a hour at 9:00pm (which is way past my dinnertime). once we were seated we sipped on pear cider which is awesome and easy to overdue by drinking too many. though it took over 90 minutes to be seated i was happy with dinner from the apps to the main course. we had mussels as an app to share and another person had the shortrib flatbread pizza to share which everyone who are meat eaters and they all loved it. i had the salmon over mashed sweet potatoes and it was amazing, definitely worth the wait.let\\'s get to my more recent visit which was the visit from hell. i made reservations this go round because it was the weekend after christmas and we were a party of 8. the best part about this visit was that we were seated immediately at the table that is elevated over the restaurant straight to the back. we had a waitress come over to the table by the name of tasha remember that name and be sure to never have her as your waitress ever especially if you have people in your party that she may have liked or may have crushed on and didn\\'t get any play. this young lady was very short with us and we were in the christmas spirit and sharing our holiday cheer. we were ordering our apps and drinks and when some was trying to tell her \"that\\'s 7 pear ciders\" she quickly replied \"wait hold up, one person at a time\". that\\'s not so bad you say, however you had to see her face of disgust like she didn\\'t want to be there or be our server. i shared my phone with her to show her that i checked in on yelp and i unlocked the yelp offer for cornbread which she looked at and shunned my phone back over to me \" my gold iphone 5s\" really. i continued to maintain my composure and began fellowshipping with my group as we waited on our drinks and apps. about 15 minutes later some of the drinks came and one of the 5 apps. another 20 minutes later we flagged her down and she decided to bring the rest of the apps (cold) and we inquired about the cornbread and she rolled her eyes and walked away. note:we didn\\'t get the cornbread until after our entrees were served. we ordered our entrees again after flagging her down and practically begging her to come over to our table and help us as we were hungry. this young lady tasha was thee worst waitress i\\'ve ever had in nyc and i know that nyc is known to be cut throat or rude however i\\'m from chicago so i know a thing or two about ignorance and how to handle it as well as how to offset it in a nice/nasty way.icing on the cake: tasha came by to clear the table without asking us if we were done with our plates or even asking if she could clear the table, she just started grabbing stuff and we had to pull plates out of her hand that we were still working on and one item in particular that she removed was the cheesecake and in the process the cheesecake feel onto the chanel leather glove of one of the ladies at the table and you would think tasha would acknowledge this mess with not just a look but an apology and a swift sprint to grab something to clean the glove off. ooh no, tasha kept clearing the table while everyone looked with wide-eyes except me as i just can\\'t tolerate ignorance and disrespect for any reason for so long. i stated \"excuse me, you just dropped cheesecake on her glove\" and she gave me this look as if she was trying to cut my throat with her eyes and walked away and came back and dropped a napkin on the table on top of the glove and walked away. she returned to drop the check and once i grabbed the check and noticed that her tip was about $85 automatically i immediately asked for a manager. my issue: the manager listened to the table express a group consensus of how rude tasha was from start to finish. no one asked to not pay the tip; we just ask that it be redirected to the kitchen for the amazing food and to the dishwashers as the dishes were clean and sparkling. we refuse to give her a dime; however the manager sugar coated her actions and made it seem like she may have been having a bad day as if it was acceptable for her to express her bad day toward individuals patronizing this establishment and spending a large chunk of change. the sad part is that i\\'m sure nothing was done and she received that tip because he seemed pretty sweet on her and compassionate for her regardless of her actions which is why i have no plans on no visits to nyc to see family to patronize this establishment again or no plans to add soco to my list of places to try for those who look to me for travel advice due to my extensive travels.'),\n",

(commissioner profiled in the washington post)it\\'s a small \"artisanal\" menu split between appetizers and entrees. we had the cucumber salad, eggplant, turnip cake, claims & basil (incl. scallion pancake), and pork buns for appetizers, plus mullet roe noodles, beef rolls, and something else that i forgot. the only \"bust\" was the cucumber salad, which felt like something you could easily make at home and that depended less on a creative recipe than the intrinsic tastes of the cucumber itself.win son allows you the choice of sitting outside or inside, and if it\\'s a nice day, i definitely recommend the former option. it\\'s not because i necessarily love being outdoors. on the contrary, see my las veganization of the world sudden-death climate change strategy plan where we will all have to live in bubbles but get to watch lady gaga and cirque du soleil shows all day. but the inside of win so is awful. sadly, like many restaurant, it\\'s taken the advice that loud pulsating \"club\" music is desirable. it really impedes paced eating and conversation. were we inside, i would have given this place a flat 3, maybe even 2 star, rating. that\\'s how bad it is. if you want a club, go to live 1oak or catch or whatever.final note: samuel b. had me thinking win son was a hole-in-the-wall place with bad decor and suspect sanitary standards that served delicious food. it\\'s not. it\\'s incredibly well manicured, and it made me wonder whether the place is truly owned by actual taiwanese/asian proprietors. bzzz!!!... no. it\\'s run by one \"trigg brown.\" this raises a perennial question here: is this cultural appropriation to be lamented or cultural syncretism to be celebrated? we debated it as a group, and we settled on the latter, though not without some unease. i personally was finally swayed when i recalled that my favorite peking duck joints in nyc are all owned by people who don\\'t look like me. john a. said that the best pizza shops are owned by albanians, and as an italian, he doesn\\'t take offense. ultimately, with so much hardening of borders in today\\'s society, what\\'s the harm of a little cultural fusion?'),\n",

(please see the attached pic.) and they cost $11. i\\'ll give them this--the flavor was good. too bad there was no real meat to taste them on. i mean, really, wtf. i ordered a side of collard greens with them ($7, but that\\'s not too abnormal for a side dish) that was decent. i wasn\\'t mad at them and would eat them again, but i don\\'t think i\\'d pay more than $5 for the amount served.my friends were similarly disappointed with their meals and drink orders. one did the wings and elotes, one did the catfish (which she said tasted like dirt) and the buffalo chicken bucket (which she said was dry and tasted old), and they split a side of mac and cheese, which they both said was \"just ok.\" they ended up sending all their food back.what was especially upsetting is that when we asked to speak to the manager and talked about a) the freshness of the food, b) the quality of the food, and c) the portion sizes, the manager had the audacity to say to us, \"well this isn\\'t a popeye\\'s drive thru.\" !!! the gall! sir, if this was a popeye\\'s, i would\\'ve been satisfied with my order. this most certainly is not a popeye\\'s drive thru, but i wish it had been. i am trying to resist saying that that comment was racial in tone because it was said to three black women by a white man, but f* it, i just did. nobody would insinuate to white people that they\\'re used to eating at fast food places and can\\'t understand the difference between a drive thru and a sit-down restaurant.after our complaints and our lack of eating, you\\'d think the manager would offer to comp our drinks and/or food, make us something else, or at the very least, apologize. none of the above happened, and we were delivered a check for $128 for nearly inedible food. my first thought was to leave without paying, but i\\'m an adult, so i paid for this terrible meal and, after this review, will put the bad experience out of my mind.i must say as a disclaimer: the actual price of the food wasn\\'t the problem. i am from and live in dc, where prices are exactly the same, but value is high. no one balked at the prices of the food or drinks until they were brought out. i feel like i need to say that before someone thinks that my party and i were being cheap or were unaccustomed to city prices...anyone who has been to dc knows that nothing here is cheap.if you were looking forward to trying sweet chick, don\\'t go to this one. this is the only location i\\'ve been to, so i can\\'t vouch for the others, but i can definitively say this is not the one.'),\n",
